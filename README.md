# Investigate-Business-Hotel-using-Data-Visualization
It is very important for a company to always analyze its business performance. Business performance analysis could help in finding problems and then put in place strategies to solve the issues, so that the company can reach their optimal potential.  In this post, we will explore more about hotel business to find some insights. Our focus is to analyze customer behaviour in making hotel reservations, and which factor has the impact of cancellation rate of the reservations. The results of the insights we found later will be presented through visualizations for better understanding. The dataset that will be used today is a dummy data contains a single file which compares various booking information between two hotels: a city hotel and a resort hotel.
